## Mission Brief Sent

```
Create a foundation file for PerchNotes.

First, quickly scan the project files to understand what it does.

Then create `.claude/templates/context.json` with:
1. A concise mission statement (1-2 sentences about what the project does and who it's for)
2. 3-5 user personas (name, role, goals, pain points, technical skill)

Use this JSON format:
```json
{
  "projectName": "PerchNotes",
  "projectPath": "/Users/sarahwilkerson/Developer/PerchNotes",
  "missionStatement": "your mission statement here",
  "userPersonas": [
    {
      "id": "persona-1",
      "name": "Name",
      "role": "Role",
      "goals": ["goal 1", "goal 2"],
      "painPoints": ["pain 1", "pain 2"],
      "characteristics": ["skill level", "traits"]
    }
  ],
  "contextLastUpdated": "2025-10-21T02:31:12Z"
}
```

Steps:
1. Read a few key files to understand the project
2. Create `.claude/templates/` directory (mkdir -p)
3. Write the context.json file with mission and personas

Keep it simple and actionable. Don't overthink it.

> Create a foundation file for PerchNotes.

First, quickly scan the project files to understand what it does.

Then create `.claude/templates/context.json` with:
1. A concise mission statement (1-2 sentences about what the project does and who it's for)
2. 3-5 user personas (name, role, goals, pain points, technical skill)

Use this JSON format:
```json
{
  "projectName": "PerchNotes",
  "projectPath": "/Users/sarahwilkerson/Developer/PerchNotes",
  "missionStatement": "your mission statement here",
  "userPersonas": [
    {
      "id": "persona-1",
      "name": "Name",
      "role": "Role",
      "goals": ["goal 1", "goal 2"],
      "painPoints": ["pain 1", "pain 2"],
      "characteristics": ["skill level", "traits"]
    }
  ],
  "contextLastUpdated": "2025-10-21T02:31:12Z"
}
```

Steps:
1. Read a few key files to understand the project
2. Create `.claude/templates/` directory (mkdir -p)
3. Write the context.json file with mission and personas

Keep it simple and actionable. Don't overthink it.

⏺ I'll help you create a foundation file for PerchNotes. Let me first scan a few key files to understand what the
  project does.

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/Info.plist)

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/PerchNotesAppDelegate.swift)
  ⎿  Read 118 lines(B

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/Views/PerchNotesView.swift)
  ⎿  Read 987 lines(B

⏺ Now I understand the project. Let me create the context.json file with a mission statement and user personas.

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .claude/templates)
  ⎿  (No content)(B

⏺ Write(.claude/templates/context.json)
  ⎿  Error writing file

⏺ Let me create the file using a different approach:

⏺ Bash(cat > .claude/templates/context.json << 'EOF'

> Create a foundation file for PerchNotes.

First, quickly scan the project files to understand what it does.

Then create `.claude/templates/context.json` with:
1. A concise mission statement (1-2 sentences about what the project does and who it's for)
2. 3-5 user personas (name, role, goals, pain points, technical skill)

Use this JSON format:
```json
{
  "projectName": "PerchNotes",
  "projectPath": "/Users/sarahwilkerson/Developer/PerchNotes",
  "missionStatement": "your mission statement here",
  "userPersonas": [
    {
      "id": "persona-1",
      "name": "Name",
      "role": "Role",
      "goals": ["goal 1", "goal 2"],
      "painPoints": ["pain 1", "pain 2"],
      "characteristics": ["skill level", "traits"]
    }
  ],
  "contextLastUpdated": "2025-10-21T02:31:12Z"
}
```

Steps:
1. Read a few key files to understand the project
2. Create `.claude/templates/` directory (mkdir -p)
3. Write the context.json file with mission and personas

Keep it simple and actionable. Don't overthink it.

⏺ I'll help you create a foundation file for PerchNotes. Let me first scan a few key files to understand what the
  project does.

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/Info.plist)
  ⎿  Read 33 lines(B

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/PerchNotesAppDelegate.swift)
  ⎿  Read 118 lines(B

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/Views/PerchNotesView.swift)
  ⎿  Read 987 lines(B

⏺ Now I understand the project. Let me create the context.json file with a mission statement and user personas.

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .claude/templates)
  ⎿  (No content)(B

⏺ Write(.claude/templates/context.json)
  ⎿  Error writing file

⏺ Let me create the file using a different approach:

⏺ Bash(cat > .claude/templates/context.json << 'EOF'
      {…)
  ⎿  Running…

> Create a foundation file for PerchNotes.

First, quickly scan the project files to understand what it does.

Then create `.claude/templates/context.json` with:
1. A concise mission statement (1-2 sentences about what the project does and who it's for)
2. 3-5 user personas (name, role, goals, pain points, technical skill)

Use this JSON format:
```json
{
  "projectName": "PerchNotes",
  "projectPath": "/Users/sarahwilkerson/Developer/PerchNotes",
  "missionStatement": "your mission statement here",
  "userPersonas": [
    {
      "id": "persona-1",
      "name": "Name",
      "role": "Role",
      "goals": ["goal 1", "goal 2"],
      "painPoints": ["pain 1", "pain 2"],
      "characteristics": ["skill level", "traits"]
    }
  ],
  "contextLastUpdated": "2025-10-21T02:31:12Z"
}
```

Steps:
1. Read a few key files to understand the project
2. Create `.claude/templates/` directory (mkdir -p)
3. Write the context.json file with mission and personas

Keep it simple and actionable. Don't overthink it.

⏺ I'll help you create a foundation file for PerchNotes. Let me first scan a few key files to understand what the
  project does.

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/Info.plist)
  ⎿  Read 33 lines(B

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/PerchNotesAppDelegate.swift)
  ⎿  Read 118 lines(B

⏺ Read(PerchNotes/Views/PerchNotesView.swift)
  ⎿  Read 987 lines(B

⏺ Now I understand the project. Let me create the context.json file with a mission statement and user personas.

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .claude/templates)
  ⎿  (No content)(B

⏺ Write(.claude/templates/context.json)
  ⎿  Error writing file

⏺ Let me create the file using a different approach:

⏺ Bash(cat > .claude/templates/context.json << 'EOF'
      {…)
  ⎿  Running…
