This is a sample note to help you learn how PerchNotes handles deletions.

When you delete a note:
â€¢ It moves to Trash (not permanently deleted)
â€¢ You have 30 days to restore it
â€¢ After 30 days, it auto-deletes

**Try It:**
Click the trash icon in the Library to see how it works. You can always restore it from the Trash folder in the sidebar!
